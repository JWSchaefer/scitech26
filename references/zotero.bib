  abstract = {Proton-Exchange Membrane-Fuel Cells (PEM-FC) are regarded as one
              of the prime candidates to provide emissions-free electricity for
              propulsion systems of aircraft. Here, a turbocharged Fuel Cell
              Power System (FCPS) powered with liquid H2 (LH2) is designed and
              modelled to provide a primary power source in retrofitted Cessna
              208 Caravan aircraft. The proposed FCPS comprises multiple PEM-FCs
              assembled in stacks, two single-stage turbochargers to mitigate the
              variation of the ambient pressure with altitude, two preheaters,
              two humidifiers, and two combustors. Interlinked component
              sub-models are constructed in MATLAB and referenced to commercially
              available equipment. The FCPS model is used to simulate
              steady-state responses in a proposed 1.5~h ({$\sim$}350~km) mission
              flight, determining the overall efficiency of the FCPS at 43\% and
              hydrogen consumption of {$\sim$}28~kg/h. The multi-stack FCPS is
              modelled applying parallel fluidic and electrical architectures,
              analysing two power-sharing methods: equally distributed and
              daisy-chaining. The designed LH2-FCPS is then proposed as a power
              system to a retrofitted Cessna 208 Caravan, and with this example
              analysed for the probability of failure occurrence. The results
              demonstrate that the proposed ``dual redundant'' FCPS can reach
              failure rates comparable to commercial jet engines with a rate
              below 1.6 failures per million hours.},

  abstract = {Recently, hydrogen and fuel cells have gained interest as an
              emerging technology to mitigate the effects of climate change
              caused by the aviation sector. The aim of this work is to evaluate
              the applicability of this technology to an existing regional
              aircraft in order to assess its electrification, with the aim of
              reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainability
              goals. The design of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell system
              (PEMFC) with the inclusion of liquid hydrogen storage is carried
              out. Specifically, a general mathematical model is developed, which
              involves multiple scales, ranging from individual cells to aircraft
              scale. First, the fuel cell electrochemical model is developed and
              validated against published polarization curves. Then, different
              sizing approaches are used to compute the overall weight of the
              hydrogen-based propulsion system, in order to optimize the system
              and minimize its weight. Crucially, this work underscores that the
              feasibility of hydrogen-based fuel cell systems relies not only on
              hydrogen storage but especially on the electrochemical cell
              performance, which influences the size of the balance of plant and
              especially its thermal management section. In particular, the
              strategic significance of working with fuel cells at partial loads
              is demonstrated. This entails achieving an optimal balance between
              the stacks oversizing and the weights of both hydrogen storage and
              balance of plant, thereby minimizing the overall weight of the
              system. It is thus shown that an integrated approach is imperative
              to guide progress towards efficient and implementable hydrogen
              technology in regional aviation. Furthermore, a high-performance
              PEMFC is analyzed, resulting in an overall weight reduction up to
              nearly 10\% compared to the baseline case study. In this way, it is
              demonstrated as technological advancements in PEMFCs can offer
              further prospects for improving system efficiency.},

  abstract = {A model and software for design and analysis of a Proton Exchange
              Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system are developed for hydrogen eVTOL
              aircraft. Examples are provided of stacks designed for 80 kWe and
              500 kWe net electrical power. Examples are provided of eVTOL
              designed for 250 and 400 lb payload. The trade-offs included stack
              characteristics, hydrogen storage characteristics, and aircraft
              payload and range. The objectives were to identify the key
              technology drivers of a hydrogen rotorcraft, establish technology
              targets for a viable aircraft, and recommend research to address
              the fundamental pre-competitive barriers. The current U.S.
              infrastructure on hydrogen informed the targets and
              recommendations. The key conclusion is that the advances made in
              cell electrochemical power density over the last decade might allow
              a PEMFC system to meet, or even beat, piston engine powered
              light-utility rotorcraft. The development must focus on the key
              drivers of a hydrogen eVTOL. The drivers are ultra-light stack
              cooling and short-term hydrogen storage. A stack system of net
              electrical power 100-150 kWe with specific power 1.1 kWe/kg
              including air, cooling, and electrical subsystems, and a tank
              storage of 15\% weight fraction hydrogen are the minimum targets to
              meet the performance of a modern piston-engine rotorcraft, with a
              range of 180 nautical miles, payload of 400 lb, and gross weight of
              about 1400 lb. This is defined as the objective aircraft. If only
              one target is met, an aircraft of half the range could be produced,
              with a 30\% greater gross take-off weight. This is defined as an
              intermediate aircraft. Because definitive conclusions are premature
              without weights and loads data on a flight-worthy stack system, it
              is recommended that a fuel cell powered hydrogen eVTOL demonstrator
              be built and flown. The existing hydrogen infrastructure for cars
              provide ample opportunity to create a pilot program. About 12
              metric tons of retail hydrogen are available for cars every day in
              California, which is less than 0.05\% of the yearly hydrogen
              production in the U.S.. A hypothetical fleet of 100 aircraft,
              operating 3 flights a day, would increase the demand by 2.25 tons
              per day and require 140 MWh of renewable electricity for green
              hydrogen.},

              decreased. However, at a low cell voltage of 200~mV, we found the

              to the increased electro-osmotic drag. This trend is independent of

              oxide emissions and contrail formation to analyse aviation's total

              observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being
              responsible for only 2.4\% of global annual emissions of CO2.
              Aviation is projected to cause a total of about 0.1 {$^\circ$}C of
              warming by 2050, half of it to date and the other half over the
              next three decades, should aviation's pre-COVID growth resume. The
              industry would then contribute a 6\%--17\% share to the remaining

              accurately predict the distribution of the major physical
              quantities that are transported within a proton exchange membrane
              (PEM) fuel cell is presented. The toolbox has been developed using
              the Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM)
              platform, which is an open-source computational fluid dynamics
              (CFD) code. The base case results for the distribution of velocity,
              pressure, chemical species, Nernst potential, current density, and
              temperature are as expected. The plotted polarization curve was
              compared to the results from a numerical model and experimental
              data taken from the literature. The conducted simulations have
              generated a significant amount of data and information about the
              transport processes that are involved in the operation of a PEM
              fuel cell. The key role played by the concentration constant in
              shaping the cell polarization curve has been explored. The
              development of the present toolbox is in line with the objectives
              outlined in the International Energy Agency (IEA, Paris, France)
              Advanced Fuel Cell Annex 37 that is devoted to developing
              open-source computational tools to facilitate fuel cell
              technologies. The work therefore serves as a basis for devising
              additional features that are not always feasible with a commercial

  abstract = {The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a promising
              candidate as zero-emission power source for transport and
              stationary cogeneration applications due to its high efficiency,
              low-temperature operation, high power density, fast start-up, and
              system robustness. Bipolar plate is a vital component of PEM fuel
              cells, which supplies fuel and oxidant to reactive sites, removes
              reaction products, collects produced current and provides
              mechanical support for the cells in the stack. Bipolar plates
              constitute more than 60\% of the weight and 30\% of the total cost
              in a fuel cell stack. For this reason, the weight, volume and cost
              of the fuel cell stack can be reduced significantly by improving
              layout configuration of flow field and use of lightweight
              materials. Different combinations of materials, flow-field layouts
              and fabrication techniques have been developed for these plates to
              achieve aforementioned functions efficiently, with the aim of
              obtaining high performance and economic advantages. The present
              paper presents a comprehensive review of the flow-field layouts

              objective of this paper is to examine the potential of hydrogen
              fuel cells to overcome this drawback. The paper develops
              steady-state and transient models of fuel cells and batteries, and
              it validates the models experimentally. It demonstrates fuel cell
              and battery power sharing in a regulated parallel configuration to
              achieve a reduction in powerplant weight. Finally, the paper
              outlines the weight models of motors, batteries, and fuel cells
              needed for eVTOL sizing, and it carries out a sizing analysis for
              on-demand urban air-taxi missions. This revealed that, for ranges
              within 75 miles, a lightweight (5000--6000 lb gross weight)
              all-electric tilting proprotor configuration is feasible with

              mission beyond 50 miles, fuel cells appear to be a compelling
              candidate. Although fuel cells alone do not offer significant
              improvements to batteries, the two electric power sources can be
              combined for significant payload gains. In the combined powerplant,
              the fuel cell is sized to the low-power cruise mode and the battery
              supplements during higher power. For missions of less than 50 miles
              , the combination provides no advantage with current technology,
              and battery specific energy is the principal driver.},

  abstract = {Recently, a fuel cell-battery hybrid system (FBHS) has attracted
              considerable attention as a potential propulsion system for
              electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. For the
              conceptual design of FBHS-powered eVTOL aircraft, the FBHS sizing
              method requires parameterized weight estimation that reflects the
              power distribution ratio between the two power sources and the
              expected production time point. However, previous studies on FBHS
              sizing mainly focused on weight estimation based on actual product
              data. Thus, this study proposes a refined sizing method of FBHS for
              eVTOL aircraft that meets the requirements necessary at the
              conceptual design phase. The sizing method was parameterized at the
              component level, and the operating characteristics of the battery
              and fuel cell were reflected in the sizing. Each battery and fuel
              cell system sizing was performed, and the results showed that it is
              necessary to consider the operating characteristics of the battery
              or fuel cell when sizing rather than simply using constant specific
              energy or power. The FBHS-powered eVTOL aircraft sizing and
              sensitivity analysis were performed using the proposed method,
              considering the power distribution ratio between the two power
              sources. The results were derived by quantifying the technological
              development trends of each FBHS component and matching the expected
              production time to 2025 and 2035. In addition, the battery charging
              time required to fully charge the battery after performing all
              missions was calculated. The results indicated that the operational
              and manufacturing plan should be considered when designing the
              FBHS-powered eVTOL aircraft and prioritizing investments in
              technologies necessary for viable FBHS-powered eVTOL aircraft.},

              technological paradigm shift within the commercial aviation

              with events that have impacted them (COVID-19, grounding of
              Boeing's 737-Max model, corporate espionage). The technology itself

  abstract = {Reference No. ISABE-2022-291 - The emission of greenhouse gases is
              causing a rising global average temperature and extreme climate
              events. The European Commission has set ambitious goals until 2050
              to reduce CO2 and NOx emissions in aviation. But to reach these
              goals revolutionary developments are necessary since the
              optimization potential of conventional technologies is limited.
              Propulsion systems powered by proton exchange membrane fuel cells
              (PEMFC) emit only water vapor and would reduce the climate impact
              of aviation. Therefore, the feasibility of hydrogen powered PEMFC
              propulsion systems for the application in different aircraft
              categories is analyzed. A basic fuel cell model is integrated in
              the virtual engine framework GTlab. The influence of major design
              parameters on the behavior of the system is analyzed. Fuel
              cell-based propulsion systems are designed for four aircraft
              applications that differ in flight operating conditions, payload
              and range. The designed hydrogen fuel-cell-powered propulsion
              systems are compared to the corresponding conventional
              kerosene-fueled engines. The implications on system efficiency,
              size and mass including the hydrogen storage are discussed. High
              operating temperatures (e.g. 180{$^\circ$}C) are crucial to keep
              the cooling system at a reasonable size. For a current technology
              level, a typical regional aircraft application with a mission range
              of 1320 km shows the lowest weight increase (18\% of TOWref).
              Assuming a technology level for entry into service in 2040, the
              mass increases by only 7.4\%. For a short- to mid-range scenario
              with future assumptions the mass increases by 55\% of TOWref. These

              Anyhow, a fuel cell powered propulsion system is not convenient for

              of two additional scenarios (general aviation, commuter aircraft),

  abstract = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cells are considered to be a
              promising technology for future low-emission aircraft. However, the
              actual performance of fuel cell systems under aviation conditions
              is still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this work develops
              a detailed model of a fuel cell system for the propulsion of a
              regional aircraft. The interaction of the stacks and auxiliary
              components is studied with validated models for the fuel cell stack
              , humidifier, heat exchanger and compressor. These models are
              coupled with a novel sizing approach that finds the smallest
              feasible combination of components while optimizing the stack
              operating conditions for each flight phase. Based on this approach,
              a wide range of possible fuel cell system designs is compared in
              terms of their mass, efficiency, drag and volume. The results show
              that it is beneficial to optimize these performance criteria
              simultaneously in a pareto optimization problem. The aircraft's
              electrical power demand of 3.12~MW is provided by ten identical 312
              ~kW fuel cell systems that are distributed along the wing. Based on
              the model, such a 312~kW fuel cell system is predicted to achieve
              an efficiency of 39~\% during cruise and 49~\% on ground, a
              specific power of 0.50~kW/kg, a power density of 0.39~kW/L and a
              cruise drag of 333~N. Compared to conventional aircraft engines,
              fuel cells have the drawback of an increased mass and drag. The
              achievable propulsion system efficiency with fuel cells is lower
              than that of large turbofan engines, but higher than that of
              turboprop engines for regional aircraft.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for air travel in the commercial sector leads
              to an increase in global emissions, whose mitigation entails
              transitioning from the current fossil-fuel based generation of
              aircrafts to a cleaner one within a short timeframe. The use of
              hydrogen and fuel cells has the potential to reach zero emissions
              in the aerospace sector, provided that required innovation and
              research efforts are substantially accomplished. Development
              programs, investments and new regulations are needed for this
              technology to be safe and economical. In this context, it makes
              sense to develop a model-based preliminary design methodology for a
              hybrid regional aircraft assisted by a battery hybridized fuel cell
              powertrain. The technological assumptions underlying the study
              refer to both current and expected data for 2035. The major
              contribution of the proposed methodology is to provide a
              mathematical tool that considers the interactions between the
              choice of components in terms of installed power and energy
              management. This simultaneous study is done because of the
              availability of versatile control maps. The tool was then deployed
              to define current and future technological scenarios for fuel cell,
              battery and hydrogen storage systems, by quickly adapting control
              strategies to different sizing criteria and technical
              specifications. In this way, it is possible to facilitate the
              estimation of the impact of different sizing criteria and
              technological features, at the aircraft level, on the onboard
              electrical system, the management of in-flight power, the
              propulsion methods, the impact of the masses on consumption and
              operational characteristics in a typical flight mission. The
              proposed combination of advanced sizing and energy management
              strategies allowed meeting mass and volume constraints with
              state-of-the-art PEM fuel cell and Li-ion battery specifications.
              Such a solution corresponds to a high degree of hybridization
              between the fuel cell system and battery pack (i.e., 300~kW and 750
              kWh), whereas projected 2035 specs were demonstrated to help reduce
              mass and volume by 23~\% and 40~\%, respectively.},

              models have been developed in science and industrial applications,
              almost none of which have been fully disclosed to the public. There
              is a large need for standardization and establishing a common
              ground not only in experimental characterization of fuel cells, but
              also in the development of simulation codes, to prevent each
              research group from having to start anew from scratch. Here, we
              publish the first open standalone implementation of a full-blown,
              steady-state, non-isothermal two-phase model for low-temperature
              PEM fuel cells. It is based on macro-homogeneous modeling
              approaches and implements the most essential through-plane
              transport processes in a five-layer MEA. The focus is on code
              simplicity and compactness with only a few hundred lines of clearly
              readable code, providing a starting point for more complex model
              development. The model is implemented as a standalone MATLAB
              function, based on MATLAB's standard boundary value problem solver.
              The default simulation setup reflects wide-spread commercially
              available MEA materials. Operating conditions recommended for
              automotive applications by the European Commission are used to
              establish new fuel cell simulation base data, making our program a

              appropriate management of water in the membrane electrode. One
              solution is to apply an external humidifier to the supply gases.
              However, the operating conditions change continuously, which
              significantly affects the humidifier performance and supply gas
              characteristics. A straightforward humidifier module is needed for
              integration with the fuel cell system model. In this study, a
              lumped-mass model was used to simulate a hollow-fiber membrane
              humidifier and investigate the effects of various input conditions
              on the humidifier performance. The lumped-mass model can account
              for heat transfer and vapor transport in the membrane bundle
              without losing simplicity. The humidifier module was divided into
              three parts: a heat and mass exchanger in the middle and two
              manifolds at the ends of the exchanger. These components were
              modeled separately and linked to each other according to the flow
              characteristics. Simulations were performed to determine the
              humidifier response under both steady-state and transient
              conditions, and water saturation was observed in the outlet
              manifold that may affect the humidifier performance. The findings
              on the effects of the operating conditions and humidifier

              devices that convert chemical energy directly into electricity and
              vice versa. They have attracted sustainable attention over the past
              decade from multiple experimental and numerical studies. However,
              detailed experimental investigations are typically expensive and
              challenging for providing a number of operating conditions and
              designs. Computational analysis offers an alternative approach for
              these studies. With the steadily increasing high-performance
              computing resources available, the limitations of numerical
              simulations have substantially decreased. This contribution details
              the design choice and code structure of modern electrochemical

              named openFuelCell2 within the open-source platform OpenFOAM,

              powerful tool for studying electrochemical devices in a
              comprehensive and efficient manner. Solution method: This software
              utilizes the finite volume method (FVM) to discretize and solve all
              conserved variables governed by partial differential equations. It
              employs a variant of the SIMPLE and PISO algorithms, known as
              PIMPLE, to solve the pressure-velocity coupling. All of the
              transport equations are solved sequentially, except for the
              enthalpy equation which is solved in an implicitly coupled manner
              within the global domain. Additional comments including
              restrictions and unusual features:{$\bullet$}The two-phase flow
              consists of continuous and dispersed phases, without resolving the
              phase interfaces.{$\bullet$}The two-phase flow is solved with an
              Eulerian-Eulerian approach.{$\bullet$}A local-time-stepping method
              was typically used in the two-phase solution.{$\bullet$}The
              electrochemical reactions take place in volumetric regions.{$
              \bullet$}Species diffusion is described by Fick's law.},
