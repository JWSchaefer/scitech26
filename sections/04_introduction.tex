\section{Introduction}

\lettrine{T}{his} document is a \LaTeX{} template for preparation of papers for AIAA Technical Conferences. If you are reading a hard-copy or .pdf version of this document, download the electronic file, new-aiaa.cls, and use it to prepare your manuscript.

Authors using \url{https://www.overleaf.com} may simply open the AIAA template from the Overleaf gallery to work online; no local installation of any files is required. Authors using a local \LaTeX{} installation will need to open the template in Overleaf and use the ``Download as zip'' option from the project menu to download a local copy of the template files. To create your formatted manuscript, type your own text over sections of the template, or cut and paste from another document and then use the available markup styles. Note that special formatting such as subscripts, superscripts, and italics may be lost when you copy your text into the template from a Word Processing program such as Microsoft Word. See Sec. V for more detailed formatting guidelines.
