The emission of greenhouse gases is causing a rising global average temperature and extreme climate events. The European Commission has set ambitious goals until 2050 to reduce CO2 and NOx emissions in aviation. But to reach these goals revolutionary developments are necessary since the optimization potential of conventional technologies
is limited. Propulsion systems powered by proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) emit only water vapor and would reduce the climate impact of aviation. Therefore, the feasibility of hydrogen powered PEMFC propulsion systems for the application in different aircraft categories is analyzed.
A basic fuel cell model is integrated in the virtual engine framework GTlab. The influence of major design parameters on the behavior of the system is analyzed. Fuel cell-based propulsion systems are designed for four aircraft applications that differ in flight operating conditions, payload and range. The designed hydrogen fuel-cell-powered propulsion systems are compared to the corresponding conventional kerosene-fueled engines. The implications on system efficiency, size and mass including the hydrogen
storage are discussed.  
High operating temperatures (e.g. 180°C) are crucial to keep the cooling system at a reasonable size. For a current technology level, a typical regional aircraft application with a mission range of 1320 km shows the lowest weight increase (18\% of TOWref). Assuming a technology level for entry into service in 2040, the mass increases by only 7.4\%. For a short- to mid-range scenario with future assumptions the mass increases by
55\% of TOWref. These results are achieved neglecting the impacts on the aircraft design. Anyhow, a fuel cell powered propulsion system is not convenient for aircraft with high thrust requirements. Combined with the results of two additional scenarios (general aviation, commuter aircraft), this work is the basis for future research in fuel cell-based propulsion systems in civil aviation.},

The focus is set on finding an efficient aircraft configuration that considers all drive train-related components such as the hydrogen tank, fuel cells, and electric motors as well as passenger seats and cargo hold. The paper starts with the definition of the design requirements and specifications. Following, the baseline design of the aircraft in the Suave tool is presented. This includes making extensions to the Suave tool regarding the compatibility of fuel cells and hydrogen energy networks. Eventually, a multidisciplinary design optimization process of selected design variables together with the design constraints is carried out in Suave. Finally, the design is evaluated in terms of performance and emissions by drawing a comparison with conventional general aviation aircraft.},

	abstract = {Recently, hydrogen and fuel cells have gained interest as an emerging technology to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by the aviation sector. The aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of this technology to an existing regional aircraft in order to assess its electrification, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainability goals. The design of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell system (PEMFC) with the inclusion of liquid hydrogen storage is carried out. Specifically, a general mathematical model is developed, which involves multiple scales, ranging from individual cells to aircraft scale. First, the fuel cell electrochemical model is developed and validated against published polarization curves. Then, different sizing approaches are used to compute the overall weight of the hydrogen-based propulsion system, in order to optimize the system and minimize its weight. Crucially, this work underscores that the feasibility of hydrogen-based fuel cell systems relies not only on hydrogen storage but especially on the electrochemical cell performance, which influences the size of the balance of plant and especially its thermal management section. In particular, the strategic significance of working with fuel cells at partial loads is demonstrated. This entails achieving an optimal balance between the stacks oversizing and the weights of both hydrogen storage and balance of plant, thereby minimizing the overall weight of the system. It is thus shown that an integrated approach is imperative to guide progress towards efficient and implementable hydrogen technology in regional aviation. Furthermore, a high-performance PEMFC is analyzed, resulting in an overall weight reduction up to nearly 10\% compared to the baseline case study. In this way, it is demonstrated as technological advancements in PEMFCs can offer further prospects for improving system efficiency.},

	abstract = {A model and software for design and analysis of a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system are developed for hydrogen eVTOL aircraft. Examples are provided of stacks designed for 80 kWe and 500 kWe net electrical power. Examples are provided of eVTOL designed for 250 and 400 lb payload. The trade-offs included stack characteristics, hydrogen storage characteristics, and aircraft payload and range. The objectives were to identify the key technology drivers of a hydrogen rotorcraft, establish technology targets for a viable aircraft, and recommend research to address the fundamental pre-competitive barriers. The current U.S. infrastructure on hydrogen informed the targets and recommendations. The key conclusion is that the advances made in cell electrochemical power density over the last decade might allow a PEMFC system to meet, or even beat, piston engine powered light-utility rotorcraft. The development must focus on the key drivers of a hydrogen eVTOL. The drivers are ultra-light stack cooling and short-term hydrogen storage. A stack system of net electrical power 100−150 kWe with specific power 1.1 kWe/kg including air, cooling, and electrical subsystems, and a tank storage of 15\% weight fraction hydrogen are the minimum targets to meet the performance of a modern piston-engine rotorcraft, with a range of 180 nautical miles, payload of 400 lb, and gross weight of about 1400 lb. This is defined as the objective aircraft. If only one target is met, an aircraft of half the range could be produced, with a 30\% greater gross take-off weight. This is defined as an intermediate aircraft. Because definitive conclusions are premature without weights and loads data on a flight-worthy stack system, it is recommended that a fuel cell powered hydrogen eVTOL demonstrator be built and flown. The existing hydrogen infrastructure for cars provide ample opportunity to create a pilot program. About 12 metric tons of retail hydrogen are available for cars every day in California, which is less than 0.05\% of the yearly hydrogen production in the U.S.. A hypothetical fleet of 100 aircraft, operating 3 flights a day, would increase the demand by 2.25 tons per day and require 140 MWh of renewable electricity for green hydrogen.},

Here, a turbocharged Fuel Cell Power System (FCPS) powered with liquid H2 (LH2) is designed and modelled to provide a primary power source in retrofitted Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft. The proposed FCPS comprises multiple PEM-FCs assembled in stacks, two single-stage turbochargers to mitigate the variation of the ambient pressure with altitude, two preheaters, two humidifiers, and two combustors. Interlinked component sub-models are constructed in MATLAB and referenced to commercially available equipment. The FCPS model is used to simulate steady-state responses in a proposed 1.5 h (∼350 km) mission flight, determining the overall efficiency of the FCPS at 43\% and hydrogen consumption of ∼28 kg/h. The multi-stack FCPS is modelled applying parallel fluidic and electrical architectures, analysing two power-sharing methods: equally distributed and daisy-chaining. The designed LH2-FCPS is then proposed as a power system to a retrofitted Cessna 208 Caravan, and with this example analysed for the probability of failure occurrence. The results demonstrate that the proposed “dual redundant” FCPS can reach failure rates comparable to commercial jet engines with a rate below 1.6 failures per million hours.},

	abstract = {Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates. Here, we model the CO2 and non-CO2 effects like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation to analyse aviation’s total warming footprint. Aviation contributed approximately 4\% to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being responsible for only 2.4\% of global annual emissions of CO2. Aviation is projected to cause a total of about 0.1 °C of warming by 2050, half of it to date and the other half over the next three decades, should aviation’s pre-COVID growth resume. The industry would then contribute a 6\%–17\% share to the remaining 0.3 °C–0.8 °C to not exceed 1.5 °C–2 °C of global warming. Under this scenario, the reduction due to COVID-19 to date is small and is projected to only delay aviation’s warming contribution by about five years. But the leveraging impact of growth also represents an opportunity: aviation’s contribution to further warming would be immediately halted by either a sustained annual 2.5\% decrease in air traffic under the existing fuel mix, or a transition to a 90\% carbon-neutral fuel mix by 2050.},

The technology itself is discussed, followed by its historical and planned implementation by the manufacturers identified. The firms' decisions surrounding hydrogen are analysed using CI/CP mapping within Capability Profiles. With the industry appearing motivated to utilise external sourcing whilst maintaining the famous duopolistic rivalry, present acquisition methods are categorised into four approaches (‘Make’, ‘Collaborate’, ‘Buy’, and one not included within earlier theorists' work, which has been labelled ‘Espionage’). With these corporate business strategies considered, individual recommendations are then given. These recommendations suggest how best to adopt the decarbonisation technologies strategically to improve competitive position as the technologies mature in competitive impact.},

There is a large need for standardization and establishing a common ground not only in experimental characterization of fuel cells, but also in the development of simulation codes, to prevent each research group from having to start anew from scratch. Here, we publish the first open standalone implementation of a full-blown, steady-state, non-isothermal two-phase model for low-temperature PEM fuel cells. It is based on macro-homogeneous modeling approaches and implements the most essential through-plane transport processes in a five-layer MEA. The focus is on code simplicity and compactness with only a few hundred lines of clearly readable code, providing a starting point for more complex model development. The model is implemented as a standalone MATLAB function, based on MATLAB’s standard boundary value problem solver. The default simulation setup reflects wide-spread commercially available MEA materials. Operating conditions recommended for automotive applications by the European Commission are used to establish new fuel cell simulation base data, making our program a valuable candidate for model comparison, validation and benchmarking.

	abstract = {Fuel cells/electrolyzers are efficient and clean electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy directly into electricity and vice versa. They have attracted sustainable attention over the past decade from multiple experimental and numerical studies. However, detailed experimental investigations are typically expensive and challenging for providing a number of operating conditions and designs. Computational analysis offers an alternative approach for these studies. With the steadily increasing high-performance computing resources available, the limitations of numerical simulations have substantially decreased. This contribution details the design choice and code structure of modern electrochemical devices, which have been implemented as a versatile C++ library named openFuelCell2 within the open-source platform OpenFOAM, allowing for large-scale parallel calculations to be performed. The solver considers the major transport phenomena in a typical electrochemical device, including fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, species and charge transfer, and electrochemical reaction. This enables numerical simulations on popular electrochemical devices, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, to be conducted. The paper also describes the domain decomposition, and parallel performance issues, as well as future applications.
Program summary
Program Title: openFuelCell2 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cvmb5xgy7h.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/openFuelCell2/openFuelCell2 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C++ Journal reference of previous version: S.B. Beale, H.-W. Choi, J.G. Pharoah, H.K. Roth, H. Jasak, D.H. Jeon, Open-source computational model of a solid oxide fuel cell, Computer Physics Communications 200 (2016) 15–26. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No Reasons for new version: This new version aims to account for additional electrochemical applications. Summary of revisions: The new version employs new code structure designs and is capable of considering two different electric potential fields and two-phase flows. Nature of problem: This software library provides a set of models for simulating electrochemical devices, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, as well as other similar devices. These systems consist of multiple components with distinct features but are coupled through properties such as temperature, species concentrations, and electric current/potentials. This software utilizes a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to enable the simulation of multiregion and multiphysics problems, accounting for heat and mass transfer, single and two-phase flow, multicomponent diffusion, electron and ion transfer, and electrochemical reactions. This toolbox provides researchers with a powerful tool for studying electrochemical devices in a comprehensive and efficient manner. Solution method: This software utilizes the finite volume method (FVM) to discretize and solve all conserved variables governed by partial differential equations. It employs a variant of the SIMPLE and PISO algorithms, known as PIMPLE, to solve the pressure-velocity coupling. All of the transport equations are solved sequentially, except for the enthalpy equation which is solved in an implicitly coupled manner within the global domain. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features:•The two-phase flow consists of continuous and dispersed phases, without resolving the phase interfaces.•The two-phase flow is solved with an Eulerian-Eulerian approach.•A local-time-stepping method was typically used in the two-phase solution.•The electrochemical reactions take place in volumetric regions.•Species diffusion is described by Fick's law.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an open-source toolbox that can be used to accurately predict the distribution of the major physical quantities that are transported within a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is presented. The toolbox has been developed using the Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) platform, which is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The base case results for the distribution of velocity, pressure, chemical species, Nernst potential, current density, and temperature are as expected. The plotted polarization curve was compared to the results from a numerical model and experimental data taken from the literature. The conducted simulations have generated a significant amount of data and information about the transport processes that are involved in the operation of a PEM fuel cell. The key role played by the concentration constant in shaping the cell polarization curve has been explored. The development of the present toolbox is in line with the objectives outlined in the International Energy Agency (IEA, Paris, France) Advanced Fuel Cell Annex 37 that is devoted to developing open-source computational tools to facilitate fuel cell technologies. The work therefore serves as a basis for devising additional features that are not always feasible with a commercial code.},

AlphaPEM is a dynamic one-dimensional (1D) physics-based PEM fuel cell system simulator, programmed in Python and experimentally validated. It offers a good balance between accuracy and execution speed. The modular architecture allows for addition of new features, and it has a user-friendly graphical interface. An automatic calibration method is proposed to match the model to the studied fuel cell. The software provides information on the internal states of the system in response to any current density and can produce polarization and EIS curves.

	abstract = {A generalized Perry–Newman–Cairns model for performance of a generic catalyst layer (CL) with the Butler–Volmer conversion function is considered. The CL polarization curve, the rate of electrochemical conversion S(x) and the thickness of the conversion domain l∗ are derived for the cases of ideal transport of ions or feed molecules. In both cases, the CL may work in the low- or high-current regime. In the low-current regime with poor ionic transport, l∗ is given by the Newman’s current-independent reaction penetration depth. In the high-current regime, l∗ is inversely proportional to the cell current, regardless of the origin of transport loss. The position and width of the transition region between the low- and high-current branches of the polarization curve are calculated. Based on these results, the features of catalyst layer performance in PEMFC, HT-PEMFC, DMFC and SOFC are discussed.},
